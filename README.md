# sensorship_lab
Our proposed lab brings together our respective work in digital ethnography and design interventions, which explore surveillance, choreographies of power and the making of a policed state. Our lab is a space for mutual provocations between technologies of surveying and ethnographic ways of seeing. This provides ethnographic practitioners a glimpse into automated investigation techniques employed by the state. These techniques are often used to inform researchers, journalists, and activists seeking to witness events in the digital age. How can ethnographers engage these tools to augment an ethnographic output? How can ethnographers engage these tools to create collaborative outputs with their interlocutors and communities? 

Our proposal will take the form of a makerspace / design lab wherein ongoing technology training sessions will be held for ethnographic practitioners interested in getting hands on experience with the tools and techniques of surveillance. This provides ethnographic practitioners a glimpse into automated investigation techniques employed by the state [oppressors]. These techniques are often used to inform researchers, journalists, and activists seeking to witness events in the digital age. How can ethnographers engage these tools to augment an ethnographic output? How can ethnographers engage these tools to create collaborative outputs with their interlocutors and communities? 


### Brew
Install homebrew for OS X
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

```
brew install numpy scipy etc etc etc
```

### Git
```
brew install git
```

### Node
```
brew install node
```

### Python
Brew will also install `python`, a programming language, and `pip`, python's package manager.

##### pip
```
brew install python
```

If this doesn't work, we can use the system's `easy_install` with:
```
sudo easy_install pip
```

### Open CV
```
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install opencv3 --HEAD
```

### Open BR
Using the already "tapped" `homebrew/science` package, run
```
brew install openbr
```

### Tweet Tracking
```
gem install t
```

```
t authorize
```

```
t accounts
```

```
t set active <user> <token>
```

```
t followers <user> > followlist.txt
```

### waybackpack
```
pip install waybackpack
```

```
waybackpack <url> --list
```
