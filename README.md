### Brew
Install homebrew for OS X
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

```
brew install numpy scipy etc etc etc
```

### Git
```
brew install git
```

### Node
```
brew install node
```

### Python
Brew will also install `python`, a programming language, and `pip`, python's package manager.

##### pip
```
brew install python
```

If this doesn't work, we can use the system's `easy_install` with:
```
sudo easy_install pip
```

### Open CV
```
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install opencv3 --HEAD
```

### Open BR
Using the already "tapped" `homebrew/science` package, run
```
brew install openbr
```

# Laboratory Usage
### theHarvester
### Face Tracker / Obfuscator
### Scraper?
